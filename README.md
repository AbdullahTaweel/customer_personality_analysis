# Customer Personality Analysis

**Customer Personality Analysis** as I quote from the publisher description is:
"Problem Statement:

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment."

## Business Requirements

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand customer behavior and preferences to enhance targeted marketing, optimize product offerings, and improve customer retention. By segmenting customers based on their demographics, spending habits, and interactions with promotions, the company can:
✅ Personalize marketing campaigns
✅ Improve customer satisfaction and retention
✅ Increase sales and profitability

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
My hypothesis fall under the following focus areas:
1. Customer Demographics & Spending Behavior
H1: Higher-income customers spend more across all product categories.
H2: Older customers are more likely to buy wine and gold products than younger customers.
H3: Customers with children spend less on luxury items (gold, wine) but more on essential products (meat, fruits).
H4: Married customers tend to make more frequent purchases than single customers.
2. Purchase Patterns & Product Preferences
H5: Customers who purchase through the website spend more than those who buy in stores.
H6: Customers who visit the website frequently are more likely to make purchases online.
H7: Customers who purchase via catalog prefer high-ticket items (gold, wine).
H8: Customers with high recency scores (recent buyers) are more likely to respond to marketing campaigns.
3. Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
H9: Customers who accepted previous campaigns are more likely to accept future campaigns.
H10: Discounts significantly impact purchasing behavior, leading to more sales.
H11: High-spending customers are less likely to respond to discount campaigns than low-spending customers.
H12: Customers who accepted campaign offers in the past have a lower recency score (they purchase more frequently).
4. Customer Segmentation & Loyalty
H13: Customers with multiple store purchases are more loyal than those who only shop online.
H14: High-value customers (top spenders) tend to shop across multiple product categories.
H15: Customers with complaints have lower spending levels than those without complaints.
H16: The number of teenagers or children in a household influences spending on specific products.
5. Churn & Retention
H17: Customers with high recency (long time since last purchase) are more likely to churn.
H18: Customers who visit the website frequently but don’t purchase are more likely to churn.
H19: Customers who have complained are more likely to stop purchasing from the company.
6. Cross-Selling & Market Basket Analysis
H20: Customers who buy wine also tend to buy meat products.
H21: Customers who buy sweets are also more likely to buy fruits.
H22: Gold product buyers are more likely to respond to premium campaigns than discount campaigns.

Note: I will try to cover all as much as the data allows. 

## Project Plan
* The project management board will include detailed tasks breakdown and this section will be updated in daily sprints.
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* The dataset is made available on Kaggle through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis 
* Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot coding assistant, and Geminin are effectively employed to achieve excellency
* The course content and the training team instruction and support are guiding the deleivery of this Project
* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
