# Customer Personality Analysis

**Customer Personality Analysis** as I quote from the publisher description is:
"Problem Statement:

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment."

## Business Requirements

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand customer behavior and preferences to enhance targeted marketing, optimize product offerings, and improve customer retention. By segmenting customers based on their demographics, spending habits, and interactions with promotions, the company can:
* ✅ Personalize marketing campaigns
* ✅ Improve customer satisfaction and retention
* ✅ Increase sales and profitability

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
My hypothesis fall under the following focus areas:
1. Customer Demographics & Spending Behavior
* H1: Higher-income customers spend more across all product categories.
* H2: Older customers are more likely to buy wine and gold products than younger customers.
* H3: Customers with children spend less on luxury items (gold, wine) but more on essential products (meat, fruits).
* H4: Married customers tend to make more frequent purchases than single customers.
2. Purchase Patterns & Product Preferences
* H5: Customers who purchase through the website spend more than those who buy in stores.
* H6: Customers who visit the website frequently are more likely to make purchases online.
* H7: Customers who purchase via catalog prefer high-ticket items (gold, wine).
* H8: Customers with high recency scores (recent buyers) are more likely to respond to marketing campaigns.
3. Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
* H9: Customers who accepted previous campaigns are more likely to accept future campaigns.
* H10: Discounts significantly impact purchasing behavior, leading to more sales.
* H11: High-spending customers are less likely to respond to discount campaigns than low-spending customers.
* H12: Customers who accepted campaign offers in the past have a lower recency score (they purchase more frequently).
4. Customer Segmentation & Loyalty
* H13: Customers with multiple store purchases are more loyal than those who only shop online.
* H14: High-value customers (top spenders) tend to shop across multiple product categories.
* H15: Customers with complaints have lower spending levels than those without complaints.
* H16: The number of teenagers or children in a household influences spending on specific products.
5. Churn & Retention
* H17: Customers with high recency (long time since last purchase) are more likely to churn.
* H18: Customers who visit the website frequently but don’t purchase are more likely to churn.
* H19: Customers who have complained are more likely to stop purchasing from the company.
6. Cross-Selling & Market Basket Analysis
* H20: Customers who buy wine also tend to buy meat products.
* H21: Customers who buy sweets are also more likely to buy fruits.
* H22: Gold product buyers are more likely to respond to premium campaigns than discount campaigns.

Power BI Dashboard interactively allows the user to test these hypothesises and extract answers to the marketing campagins strategy. 

## Project Plan
* The project management board will include detailed tasks breakdown and this section will be updated in daily sprints.
* Data preperation and cleaning.
* Data transformation and ETL.
* Clustering with K-means.
* Prediction with Random Forest.
* Power BI Dashboard Design.

## business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* Understanding the relation between the customers' profiles and their spending activities.
* Understanding the customers' preferences regarding their purchase behaviour and their products consumption.
* Understanding the effeciency of the previous marketing campagins in attracting definite part of our customers.
* Understanding the loyality indecators of the customers and our ability to retain or reengage them.

## Analysis techniques used
* Raw data were studied and re-built to become suitable for the bussiness requirements.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic and advanced visualizations were used to extract deeper insights from the data, such as pie, columns with line, stacked columns, scatter plot, multi pie charts, and heatmaps for correlations.
* Descriptive, comparetive, and predictive analysis were applied to the data.
* The data was limited and unrelated which didn't allow prediction quality, and the clustering was difficult.
* Generative AI was used to assist the comprehension of the data features and convert it to the nost insightful version.

## Ethical considerations
* The data contained the IDs of the customers and their birth year which I found unnecessary for the analysis, so I dropped any unnecessary data throughout the work.
* As I beleive the data is public for practicing and does not refer to exact company, the data has no legal issues.

## Dashboard Design
* Power BI allowed me flexibility in covering all the hypothesises in a super interactive way.
* The dashboard consists of three sections up to down as It delves deeper into the features and their relation. The three sections are easily destinguishable as I used separate colour pallets in each.
* The slicer tool allows the used to navigate through the different aspects of the data and retreive visual representations from all the visuals. For instance, if we are interested in analysing only the active customers who are married and have graduation education level, we can follow a linear path from up to down and have all the information needed.

## Unfixed Bugs
* There is a bug in the slicer in the Power BI dashboard wich I couldn't fix bit it is not harming the effecincy of the dashboard. When selecting the false values after clicking on select all then select true, selecting the false will cause the visual to become blank. To avoid that, you need to click on select all again and click on the false button afterward.

## Development Roadmap
* Selecting the dataset was the hardest part for me as I wanted to select a dataset that could be seen as a real life project. Even though my chosen dataset is small and might not be perfect for skills showcasing, I beleive it reflects my willingness to undertake data analytics tasks from new companies.
* A step by step approach was followed and on the way I implemented the intended best practices.
* Interactive dashboard was created on Power BI
* Future enhancements on the dataset should be performed and considering generating more instances using generative AI tools is an option.
